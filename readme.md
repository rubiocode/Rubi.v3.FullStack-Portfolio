## Description 

I used UIKit CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio with the following items: navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images.

### Minimum Requirements Met for a Responsive Portfolio
- [x] Functional, deployed application
- [x] GitHub repository with README describing the project
- [x] Navbar consistent on each page.
- [x] Navbar on each page contain links to Homepage, About Me, Contact Me, and Portfolio pages.
- [x] All links work.
- [x] Contains some personal information.
