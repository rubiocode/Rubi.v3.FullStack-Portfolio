## Description 

I used UIKit CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio with the following items: navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images. 

> A responsive design ensures that web applications are rendered well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

### Minimum Requirements Met for a Responsive Portfolio
- [x] Functional, deployed application
- [x] GitHub repository with README describing the project
- [x] Navbar consistent on each page.
- [x] Navbar on each page contain links to Homepage, About Me, Contact Me, and Portfolio pages.
- [x] All links work.
- [x] Contains some personal information.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to this portfolio:

In my v3 portfolio I tried having a functional Contact me form. The form works fine with my local computer unfortunately once deployed to Heroku the form no longer works. After doing some investigating it seems I will need some sort of Captcha challenge for the message to be able to go through the email security settings. 

Another improvement would be trying to have a page that loads smoothly once rendered. At the moment, it takes a few seconds for the images to load. 

In the future I would also like to implement lazy loading to the portfolio.
